<li><p>ISPC is an SPMD compiler, not an SIMD. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The code that needs to be paralleled will be written in a file with the suffix “.ispc” as a function. And we will call that function in the main.cpp.<br>Call to the ISPC function spawns a gang of ISPC program instances. All instances run ISPC code concurrently. The ISPC function will return when all instances have been completed.<br>All code in main.cpp will be executed sequentially. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>programCount</code>: the number of simultaneously executing instances in the gang. It is the same for all instances, thus called “uniform value.” This is not set by the programmer but by the run-time system. Programmers can only read it but don’t set that. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>programIndex</code>: the ID of the current instance in the gang. It is a non-uniform value, namely varying.<br>This is used to assign work to each instance. If we don’t use the programIndex to control the work to be done by each instance, they will all do all the work. Thus, there will be redundancy and no performance improvement. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>uniform</code>: a type modifier. All instances have a copy of the same value for this variable. Its use is purely an optimization. Not needed for correctness.<br>We cannot directly add a non-uniform value to a uniform value, which will cause a compile-time type error. To do so, we need a reduce_add function from the ISPC library. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Those ISPC program instances are not separate threads. The ISPC compiler generates a SIMD thread. So, the <code>programCount</code> is the vector width of the machine.<br>So, it can only run on one core. And “task” is used to achieve multi-core execution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Ways-of-assignment"><a href="#Ways-of-assignment" class="headerlink" title="Ways of assignment"></a>Ways of assignment</h2><ol>
<li><p>Interleaved assignment: the data processed by each instance is discontinuous. Namely, the subscript is: </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">programIndex+i\times programCount,i\in[0,\frac{N-programIndex}{programCount})</script></li>
<li><p>Block assignment: the data is split into several chunks, and each instance processes one chunk. So, the data is continuous. Namely, the subscript is: </p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">programIndex\times count+i, i\in[0,count),count=\frac{N}{programCount}</script></li>
<li><p>When using the block assignment, there are some situations when the cost of processing later data is more expensive than processing former data, making the assignment uneven. So, the interleaved assignment is less risky. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Since ISPC only generates one thread, continuous access to data in block assignments is less cache-friendly than discontinuous access in interleaved assignments.<br>If there are several threads, the block assignment might be more cache-friendly. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The data requested by all instances at the same time is a vector. In interleaved assignment, the data in a vector is memory continuous, while it is not in block assignment. So, in memory access, interleaved assignment is faster. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>foreach (i = 0 ... N)</code> says that these loop iterations can be paralleled, and ISPC implementation assigns iterations to program instances in a gang. The current ISPC implementation will perform a static interleaved assignment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="System-layers"><a href="#System-layers" class="headerlink" title="System layers"></a>System layers</h2><ol>
<li><p>The layers from up to down are parallel applications, compilers and parallel runtime, operating system, Micro-architecture (hardware implementation)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Different parallel models can have various combinations of concerned layers. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If we express parallelism with pthread, it goes through all layers. First the parallel application calls <code>pthread_create()</code> to access the pthread library implementation. Then, the pthread library uses System call API to ask for OS support: kernel thread management. Finally, the OS uses <code>x86-64</code> to control modern multi-core CPU. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If we express parallelism with ISPC without “task,” it doesn’t need the support of OS. The parallel application uses ISPC language to ask for the service of the ISPC compiler. The compiler will produce machine language of x86-64, including <code>AVX vector instruction</code> to control a single-core CPU. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Communication"><a href="#Communication" class="headerlink" title="Communication"></a>Communication</h1><h2 id="Shared-Address-Space"><a href="#Shared-Address-Space" class="headerlink" title="Shared Address Space"></a>Shared Address Space</h2><ol>
<li><p>The whole machine has a shared space address. When threads aren’t working together, they access their memory space. They can communicate with each other by reading or writing the same data and manipulating synchronization primitives (like locks)</p>
</li>
<li><p>This model requires hardware support to implement efficiently. In hardware implementation, any processor can directly reference any memory location.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symmetric (shared-memory) multi-processor (SMP): all processors have uniform memory access time. Namely, accessing an uncached memory address costs the same for all processors.<br>This is unscalable since the access latency will increase fast with more and more processors and memory chips.<br>The cores can share memory through a shared L3 cache or a crossbar switch with a die area of one core.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-uniform memory access (NUMA): All processors can access any memory location, but the cost of memory access (latency and bandwidth) differs for different processors. Each processor has a memory chip that is close to it.<br>This is more scalable because of the low latency and high bandwidth to local memory.<br>Cost is the increased programmer effort for performance tuning. Finding and exploiting locality is important to performance (want most memory accesses to be to local memories)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Message-Passing"><a href="#Message-Passing" class="headerlink" title="Message Passing"></a>Message Passing</h2><ol>
<li><p>Threads operate within their private address spaces and communicate by sending/receiving messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send: specifies recipient, buffer to be transmitted, and optional message identifier (“tag”)<br>receive: sender, specifies the buffer to store data, and optional message identifier</p>
</li>
<li><p>With this model, we can easily build large-scale parallel machines by interconnecting them. Hardware need not implement system-wide loads and stores to execute message-passing programs; need only be able to communicate messages.<br>However, the interconnect speed can be the system’s bottleneck. </p>
</li>
<li><p>We can implement the message-passing model with shared memory space.<br>Sending a message is copying memory from message library buffers while receiving the message is copying data from message library buffers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using less efficient software solutions, we can implement shared address space abstraction on machines without hardware support.<br>Mark all pages with shared variables as invalid at first, and the page-fault handler issues appropriate network requests</p>
</li>
<li><p>Synchronous (blocking) send and receive<br>Send(): Call returns when the sender receives an acknowledgment that the message data resides in the receiver’s address space.<br>Recv(): Call returns when data from the received message is copied into the receiver’s address space and acknowledgment sent back to the sender.<br>So, when using the message-passing model, we must be careful with the order of send() and recv() in each thread because it may easily raise a deadlock.<br>If the first call of all threads is send(), then no one is receiving, and all are waiting for someone to receive what they have sent.<br>One common way to program is to arrange one thread to send first and the receiver of that send to receive first. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-blocking asynchronous send/recv<br>Send() call returns immediately, while recv() posts intent to receive in the future and returns immediately.<br>We can use checksend() and checkrecv() to determine the actual status of the send/receipt.<br>The buffer provided to send() cannot be modified by calling the thread since message processing occurs concurrently with thread execution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Data-Parallel"><a href="#Data-Parallel" class="headerlink" title="Data Parallel"></a>Data Parallel</h2><ol>
<li><p>Data parallel has a very rigid computation structure. If it works well, it will work very well. But sometimes it just won’t work. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Nowadays, data-parallel usually takes the form of SPMD instead of SIMD. Programs perform the same function on different data elements in a collection<br><code>map(function, collection)</code>: Synchronization is implicit at the end of the map. Map returns when the function has been applied to all elements of the collection</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the function is too complicated, the result might be non-deterministic.<br>Data-parallel model (foreach) provides no specification of the order in which iterations occur and no primitives for fine-grained mutual exclusion/synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Streams: collections of elements. Elements can be processed independently.<br>Kernels: side-effect-free functions. Operate element-wise on collections. </p>
</li>
<li><p>A stream can be claimed by <code>stream&lt;ElemType&gt; name(N)</code><br>When defining the kernel function, its parameters are single elements instead of a whole collection. But when we call the kernel function, we pass the streams into the function directly. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Benefits of stream programming:<br>Functions are side-effect-free (cannot write a non-deterministic program)<br>The compiler knows program data flow: Inputs and outputs of each invocation are known in advance, and thus, prefetching can be employed to hide latency.<br>When there are multiple kernels, and the output of the last kernel is the input of the next kernel, producer-consumer locality is known in advance.<br>Implementation can be structured so the second kernel immediately processes the outputs of the first kernel. The values are stored in on-chip buffers/caches and never written to memory, which saves bandwidth.<br>These optimizations are the responsibility of the stream program compiler. Requires global program analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The drawback of stream programming is the need for a library of operators to describe complex data flows so that it might go wrong. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>stream_gather(input, indices, tmp_input)</code>: Put elements in input to tmp_input according to indices. This is called before the kernel function, and the kernel function will deal with the gathered stream.<br><code>stream_scatter(tmp_output, indices, output)</code>: Similar to stream_gather, but it is called after the kernel function, which will deal with the original stream.<br>The parameters of both functions are all stream. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Synchronization-and-Communication"><a href="#Synchronization-and-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Synchronization and Communication"></a>Synchronization and Communication</h2><ol>
<li><p>In shared address space, mutual exclusion is required for shared variables, and barriers are used to express dependencies between computation phases.<br>They can communicate through implicit loads/stores to shared variables. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In the message-passing model, the synchronizations and communications are performed by sending and receiving messages. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In the data parallel model, a single logical thread is in control, but the system may parallelize iterations of the forall loop. There is an implicit barrier at the end of the forall loop body.<br>They can also communicate through implicit loads and stores, like shared address space. There are also some special built-in primitives for more complex communication patterns, e.g., reduce</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Modern-practice"><a href="#Modern-practice" class="headerlink" title="Modern practice"></a>Modern practice</h2><ol>
<li><p>Use shared address space programming within a multi-core chip of a cluster and use message passing between chips.<br>Use the convenience of shared address space where it can be implemented efficiently (within a chip) and require explicit communication elsewhere. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Data-parallel-ish programming models support shared-memory style synchronization primitives in kernels. This could permit limited forms of inter-iteration communication. </p>
</li>
</ol>

          <h1 id="Speedup"><a href="#Speedup" class="headerlink" title="Speedup"></a>Speedup</h1><ol>
<li>Speedup (using P processors) = execution time (using 1 processor) / execution time (using P processors)</li>
<li>We can only get a speedup of less than P times when using P processors.<br>One reason is that although cores are in the same chip when they want to communicate with each other, they have to transmit information through wires, which takes some time.<br>Another reason is the imbalance in work assignments, which caused one core to have too heavy assignments while others had nothing to do but wait.<br>Communication costs can dominate a parallel computation, severely limiting speedup. Especially when you assign tasks to too many cores, each core gets little computation. </li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Parallelism"><a href="#Parallelism" class="headerlink" title="Parallelism"></a>Parallelism</h1><p>Why parallelism?<br>Before 2004, the performance of single-processors grew exponentially. However, in 2004, Intel hit the Power Density Wall. It goes too hot if you get over 100 watts in a chip and will melt. And the battery won’t hold long.</p>
<h2 id="ILP"><a href="#ILP" class="headerlink" title="ILP"></a>ILP</h2><ol>
<li>Instruction-Level Parallelism. Extract several instructions from the same instruction stream, and multiple ALUs perform multiple operations parallel (within a core). This has to be done in the semantics of a program. </li>
<li>Superscalar processor: exploit ILP within an instruction stream. Parallelism is automatically and dynamically discovered by the hardware during execution (not programmer visible)</li>
<li>Example: Pentium 4<br>Its instruction decoder will yank a whole bunch of instructions out of the instruction stream and map them to a new kind of computation called data flow computation that will track which value is generated and feed which instruction there.<br>Decoders map them to independent processing units that can each perform a subset of the whole operations.<br>Control logics try to predict what’s going on and deal with it when it predicts incorrectly. The Branch Target Buffer records all the control flow instructions to predict where they will go again. If it predicts wrong, it will back out and doesn’t commit to those results generated, flushing them away.<br>Meltdown inspector: This logic leaks information about what other processors are doing. </li>
<li>Most available ILP is exploited by a processor capable of issuing four instructions per clock, and only little performance benefits from building a processor that can issue more. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Multi-Core"><a href="#Multi-Core" class="headerlink" title="Multi-Core"></a>Multi-Core</h2><p>Before the multi-core era, the Majority of chip transistors were used to perform operations that helped a single instruction stream run fast.<br>More transistors mean a larger cache, smarter out-of-order logic, smarter branch predictor, etc. Also, more transistors get smaller transistors and, thus, higher clock frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="Simpler-cores"><a href="#Simpler-cores" class="headerlink" title="Simpler cores"></a>Simpler cores</h3><ol>
<li>It uses increasing transistor count to add more cores to the processor rather than using transistors to increase the sophistication of processor logic that accelerates a single instruction stream (e.g., out-of-order and speculative operations)</li>
<li>Each core runs a single instruction stream slower than our original large core, but the sum performance is faster. With a smaller core, the communication cost inside of a chip will be cheaper. </li>
<li>However, the original programs express no parallelism and run as one thread on one of the processor cores.</li>
<li>One way to express parallelism is by using pthreads. It will create threads to deal with the tasks we assigned. </li>
<li>Another way is called data-parallel expression. The programmer declares loop iterations independent, and a compiler might automatically generate parallel threaded code.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="SIMD-processing"><a href="#SIMD-processing" class="headerlink" title="SIMD processing"></a>SIMD processing</h3><ol>
<li>Amortize the cost/complexity of managing an instruction stream across many ALUs. The same instruction is broadcast to all ALUs, executed in parallel on all ALUs</li>
<li>Each core has an independent vector register set that is different from the regular register set. Each core has multiple ALUs to execute the same instructions for different data. </li>
<li>Only a very structural, carefully written code can be automatically vectorized by compilers. </li>
<li>When conditional executions occur, the condition will run first and create a mask according to the result, which disables the ALUs that should not execute current instructions. Those active ALUs will execute the instructions and create a new mask. This procession will continue until all ALUs have executed all conditional instructions they should execute, and then they can execute the remaining unconditional codes together again.<br>When a core can handle n elements at the same time, the performance in the worst case is 1 / n of the peak performance. </li>
<li>Instruction stream coherence (“coherent execution”): Same instruction sequence applies to all elements operated upon simultaneously.<br>“Divergent” execution: A lack of instruction stream coherence</li>
<li>Coherent execution is necessary for efficient use of SIMD processing resources. However, coherent execution is unnecessary for efficient parallelization across cores since each core can fetch/decode a different instruction stream.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="SIMD-on-modern-CPUs"><a href="#SIMD-on-modern-CPUs" class="headerlink" title="SIMD on modern CPUs"></a>SIMD on modern CPUs</h4><ol>
<li>SSE instructions: 128-bit operations: 4x32 bits or 2x64 bits (4-wide float vectors)<br>AVX instructions: 256-bit operations: 8x32 bits or 4x64 bits (8-wide float vectors)<br>AVX512 instructions: 512 bit operations: 16x32 bits or 8x64 bits (8-wide float vectors)</li>
<li>Instructions are generated by the compiler. Parallelism is explicitly requested by a programmer using intrinsics and conveyed using parallel language semantics. Finally, it is inferred by dependency analysis of loops by “auto-vectorizing” compiler. </li>
<li>Explicit SIMD: SIMD parallelization is performed at compile time. We can inspect the program binary and see SIMD instructions. </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="SIMD-on-modern-GPUs"><a href="#SIMD-on-modern-GPUs" class="headerlink" title="SIMD on modern GPUs"></a>SIMD on modern GPUs</h4><ol>
<li>It is usually SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) in GPUs, and SIMD is used to implement much of the logic. </li>
<li>Implicit SIMD: Compiler generates a scalar binary (scalar instructions). But N instances of the program are <em>always run</em> together on the processor. In other words, the interface to the hardware itself is data-parallel. </li>
<li>Hardware (not compiler) is responsible for simultaneously executing the same instruction from multiple instances on different data on SIMD ALUs</li>
<li>SIMD width of most modern GPUs ranges from 8 to 32</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Access-Memory"><a href="#Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Access Memory"></a>Access Memory</h1><ol>
<li>Memory latency: The time for a memory request (e.g., load, store) from a processor to be serviced by the memory system. Memory “access time” is a measure of latency. </li>
<li>Memory bandwidth: The rate at which the memory system can provide data to a processor</li>
<li>Stall: A processor “stalls” when it cannot run the next instruction in an instruction stream because of a dependency on a previous instruction. Accessing memory is a major source of stalls.</li>
<li>One way to reduce stall is by reducing latency.<br>One strategy is cache, which provides high bandwidth data transfer to the CPU. </li>
<li>Another way is hiding latency; namely, the latency of the memory operation is not changed; it just no longer causes reduced processor utilization.<br>One common strategy is the prefetch. All modern CPUs have logic for prefetching data into caches. Prefetching can also reduce performance if the guess is wrong (hogs bandwidth, pollutes caches)<br>The other is using multi-threading. The idea is to interleave the processing of multiple threads on the same core to hide stalls.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Multi-threading"><a href="#Multi-threading" class="headerlink" title="Multi-threading"></a>Multi-threading</h2><ol>
<li>The key idea of throughput-oriented systems is that they potentially increase the time to complete work by any one thread to improve overall system throughput when running multiple threads.<br>Sometimes, one thread is runnable, but the processor does not execute it since the core is running some other thread.</li>
<li>With more storing execution contexts in the cache, the working set per thread is smaller, and the latency hiding ability is higher.<br>Since the cache space per thread is smaller, it may go to memory more often. Thus, it relies heavily on memory bandwidth.<br>When the thread is enough to achieve 100% utilization of the core, additional threads yield no benefit. </li>
<li>The instruction decoder will choose instructions from multiple threads and fire them to the execution units where the threads are shared. The memory interface unit will detect dependencies automatically.</li>
<li>Interleaved multi-threading (a.k.a. temporal multi-threading): For each clock, the core chooses a thread and runs an instruction from the thread on the ALUs</li>
<li>Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT): The core chooses instructions from multiple threads to run on ALUs for each clock. It is an extension of the superscalar CPU design.</li>
<li>The operating system maps your pthreads to the processor’s thread execution contexts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="CPUs-and-GPUs"><a href="#CPUs-and-GPUs" class="headerlink" title="CPUs and GPUs"></a>CPUs and GPUs</h2><ol>
<li>CPU has big caches, few threads, modest memory BW, and relies mainly on caches and prefetching.<br>GPU has small caches, many threads, huge memory BW, and relies mainly on multi-threading. </li>
<li>The bandwidth of GPUs is a lot faster than CPUs. </li>
<li>In GPUs, ALUs run twice the clock rate of the rest of the chip. So, each decoded instruction runs on 32 pieces of data on the 16 ALUs over two ALU clocks. (but to the programmer, it behaves like a 32-wide SIMD operation)<br>Warp: An instruction operating on a whole vector of data at a time.<br>SM: Streaming Multi-processor. Each SM has multiple warp selectors. Each selector has multiple ALUs with different functions. The selectors in the same SM have shared the memory and L1 cache. And all selectors can run parallel. </li>
<li>A core can have multiple scalar ALUs and multiple vector ALUs. Each vector ALU can perform either MUL and ADD or ADD only.<br>The number of execution contexts determines the maximum number of threads activated in a core. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Bandwidth"><a href="#Bandwidth" class="headerlink" title="Bandwidth"></a>Bandwidth</h2><ol>
<li>If processors request data at a too high rate, the memory system cannot keep up. No amount of latency hiding helps this.</li>
<li>Organize computation to fetch data from memory less often.<br>Reuse data previously loaded by the same thread (traditional intra-thread temporal locality optimizations).<br>Share data across threads (inter-thread cooperation)</li>
<li>Request data less often (instead, do more arithmetic: it’s “free”).<br>Arithmetic intensity: Ratio of math operations to data access operations in an instruction stream.<br>The main point is that programs must have high arithmetic intensity to utilize modern processors efficiently.<br>If the data needed can be recalculated in ALUs, then don’t access memory; do the calculation. </li>
</ol>
